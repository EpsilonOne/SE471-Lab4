Problems:
A video game has three modes: beginner, intermediate and advanced. For each mode chosen by a player, the game GUI shows two control 
objects: a character selection panel and a weapon selection panel. Note that (a) under different modes the system displays different 
character selection panels and weapon selection panels, and (b) it is possible that new modes and/or new control objects may be added 
in the future. 

1.	Apply a design pattern to design the system such that the model can be easily extended to cover future changes without affecting the code on the client side. You should use a UML class diagram to document your design.
2.	Write Java code to implement your design. You should have a simple test class to show how it works.
